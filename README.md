# Bryn Mawr Bazaar

Bryn Mawr Bazaar is an easy and efficient way for people in the Bryn Mawr Community to sell/buy/donate/exchange clothes to encourage reducing waste, and reusing/exchanging used items. This will help students sustainably discard items that they will no longer use so that those items can be used by other students. These items do not only include clothing items, but also include a lot of school supplies, or everyday essentials like mattress toppers, humidifiers, etc. The app also includes services offered by Bryn Mawr students to encourage students to support small businesses and local services.
